# Supervised Machine Learning

## Introduction

Supervised machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence where models are trained on labeled datasets to predict outcomes for unseen data. This notebook focuses on two fundamental algorithms in supervised learning: **Linear Regression** and **Logistic Regression**.

### **Linear Regression**
- **Objective**: Predict continuous values by modeling the relationship between input features and a target variable.
- **Use Case**: Predicting house prices, stock prices, or any continuous outcome.

### **Logistic Regression**
- **Objective**: Predict categorical outcomes by estimating probabilities using a logistic function.
- **Use Case**: Binary classification tasks like spam detection, disease diagnosis, or customer churn prediction.
